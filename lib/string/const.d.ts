/**
 * Wrapper for compile-time-constant strings.
 *
 * Const is a wrapper for strings that can only be created from program
 * constants (i.e., string literals).  This property relies on a custom Closure
 * compiler check that `Const.from` is only invoked on
 * compile-time-constant expressions.
 *
 * Const is useful in APIs whose correct and secure use requires that certain
 * arguments are not attacker controlled: Compile-time constants are inherently
 * under the control of the application and not under control of external
 * attackers, and hence are safe to use in such contexts.
 *
 * Instances of this type must be created via its factory method
 * `Const.from` and not by invoking its constructor.  The
 * constructor intentionally takes no parameters and the type is immutable;
 * hence only a default instance corresponding to the empty string can be
 * obtained via constructor invocation.  Use Const.EMPTY
 * instead of using this constructor to get an empty Const string.
