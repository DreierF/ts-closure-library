/**
 * A string that is safe to use in URL context in DOM APIs and HTML documents.
 *
 * A SafeUrl is a string-like object that carries the security type contract
 * that its value as a string will not cause untrusted script execution
 * when evaluated as a hyperlink URL in a browser.
 *
 * Values of this type are guaranteed to be safe to use in URL/hyperlink
 * contexts, such as assignment to URL-valued DOM properties, in the sense that
 * the use will not result in a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability. Similarly,
 * SafeUrls can be interpolated into the URL context of an HTML template (e.g.,
 * inside a href attribute). However, appropriate HTML-escaping must still be
 * applied.
 *
 * Note that, as documented in `SafeUrl.unwrap`, this type's
 * contract does not guarantee that instances are safe to interpolate into HTML
 * without appropriate escaping.
 *
 * Note also that this type's contract does not imply any guarantees regarding
 * the resource the URL refers to.  In particular, SafeUrls are <b>not</b>
 * safe to use in a context where the referred-to resource is interpreted as
 * trusted code, e.g., as the src of a script tag.
 *
 * Instances of this type must be created via the factory methods
 * (`SafeUrl.fromConstant`, `SafeUrl.sanitize`),
 * etc and not by invoking its constructor. The constructor is organized in a
 * way that only methods from that file can call it and initialize with
 * non-empty values. Anyone else calling constructor will get default instance
 * with empty value.
