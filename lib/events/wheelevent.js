/**
 * @fileoverview This class aims to smooth out inconsistencies between browser
 * handling of wheel events by providing an event that is similar to that
 * defined in the standard, but also easier to consume.
 *
 * It is based upon the WheelEvent, which allows for up to 3 dimensional
 * scrolling events that come in units of either pixels, lines or pages.
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20140925/#interface-WheelEvent
 *
 * The significant difference here is that it also provides reasonable pixel
 * deltas for clients that do not want to treat line and page scrolling events
 * specially.
 *
 * Clients of this code should be aware that some input devices only fire a few
 * discrete events (such as a mouse wheel without acceleration) whereas some can
 * generate a large number of events for a single interaction (such as a
 * touchpad with acceleration). There is no signal in the events to reliably
 * distinguish between these.
 *
