 * Indicates if there is a grapheme cluster boundary between a and b.

 * emoji modifier sequences and emoji flag sequences. To cover all cases please
 * use `hasGraphemeBreakStrings`.
 *
 * There are two kinds of grapheme clusters: 1) Legacy 2) Extended. This method
 * is to check for both using a boolean flag to switch between them. If no flag
 * is provided rules for the extended clusters will be used by default.
 *
 * @param {number} a The code point value of the first character.
 * @param {number} b The code point value of the second character.
 * @param {boolean=} opt_extended If true, indicates extended grapheme cluster;
 *     If false, indicates legacy cluster. Default value is true.
 * @return {boolean} True if there is a grapheme cluster boundary between
 *     a and b; False otherwise.
