/**

/**
 * This class can be used to monitor changes in the viewport size.  Instances
 * dispatch a {@link EventType.RESIZE} event when the viewport size
 * changes.  Handlers can call {@link ViewportSizeMonitor#getSize} to
 * get the new viewport size.
 *
 * Use this class if you want to execute resize/reflow logic each time the
 * user resizes the browser window.  This class is guaranteed to only dispatch
 * `RESIZE` events when the pixel dimensions of the viewport change.
 * (Internet Explorer fires resize events if any element on the page is resized,
 * even if the viewport dimensions are unchanged, which can lead to infinite
 * resize loops.)
 *
 * Example usage:
 *  <pre>
 *    var vsm = new ViewportSizeMonitor();
 *    events.listen(vsm, EventType.RESIZE, function(e) {
 *      alert('Viewport size changed to ' + vsm.getSize());
 *    });
 *  </pre>
 *
 * Manually verified on IE6, IE7, FF2, Opera 11, Safari 4 and Chrome.
 *
 *    which this code is executing.
